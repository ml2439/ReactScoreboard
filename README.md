# Node React webpack setup template
**This template aims to save your time from setting up webpack config files to build a React App with Node.js**
## Usage
1. Clone or download this project
2. In the project directory, install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
3. Run
```bash
npm start
```
The project will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`
## What it is for
With these dependencies, webpack will bundle all `.js`, `.css`, `.scss` and `.json` files together in `dist/assets/bundle.js`. 
The current files in `src` are just for demo.
## Notes
* `autoprefixer`: Parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules. It's a plugin configured in `postcss.config.js`.
